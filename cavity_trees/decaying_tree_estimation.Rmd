# Introduction

The loss of suitable trees for birds that nest in cavities of decaying trees (cavity-nesters) may be relevant for the Site C offset accounting framework. Data on decaying trees was collected at select locations as part of habitat data collection for the Breeding Bird Follow-up Monitoring program. Decaying trees are often referred to as "wildlife trees" in BC and that term is used to refer to the data that was collected. The wildlife tree data can be used to estimate the density of decaying trees by habitat type and then extrapolated to the entire project footprint using ecosystem mapping data.

This document first describes the estimation of the number of decaying trees per hectare for various habitat types and then extrapolates to the entire Site C footprint to generate an estimate of the total number of decaying trees that may be lost to the project.

**NOTE: This document is an Rmarkdown notebook that includes R code, results, and text description. The R code is hidden by default. Individual blocks of code can be revealed using the "code" buttons wherever they occur. To show all code by default, use the pull-down menu in the top right.**

# Wildlife Tree Data

Two types of wildlife tree data were collected.

**WT50**\
Approximate total number of live decaying trees and dead standing trees \>15cm dbh within 50m of plot centre. Trees were not identified to species. Data was collected at all bird survey locations 2017-2019 (459 locations.

**WT11**\
Wildlife trees \>15cm dbh by species and decay class within 11.3m of station centre. 11.3m radius is the area of a SIVI plot ($400m^2$) . This was only collected in 2018 and 2019 at woodpecker survey stations (318 locations), so there are fewer locations than WT50.

The WT11 data will be better for this exercise: the wildlife counts are more accurate and for the same plot area that the ecosystem unit was identified.

Wildlife trees were classified according to species and by the decay classes listed below. The SN11 data does not include class 1 (live tree with no decay).

# Ecosystem Attributes

Ecosystem classification and vegetation data were collected at each location that wildlife tree data was collected. Typical soil moisture regime (SMR) , stand composition and structural stage were used as model variables to estimate wildlife tree density.

```

## Basic Summary

### Number of Samples

Note:\
SMR = Soil Moisture Regime\
P-S = Pole/Sapling

```{r message=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE}
tree_dat %>% 
  group_by(Structural_Stage, SMR) %>% 
  summarize(n = n_distinct(HabDat_ID)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "SMR", values_from = "n") %>% 
  dplyr::select(Structural_Stage, dry, mesic, moist, wet, "NA") %>% 
  kable(caption = "<strong>Table 1. Number of samples (plots) by structural stage and soil moisture regime</strong>") %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE,
                position = "left")

tree_dat %>% 
  group_by(Stand_Composition) %>% 
  summarize(n = n_distinct(HabDat_ID)) %>% 
  kable(caption = "<strong>Table 2. Number of samples (plots) by stand composistion</strong>") %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE,
                position = "left")

```

### Descriptive Stats

Boxplots below show (from inside out): median, first and third quartiles, minimum and maximum and outliers.

```{r message=FALSE}
tree_dat %>% 
  filter(Structural_Stage != "Herb") %>% 
  group_by(HabDat_ID, Structural_Stage, Stand_Composition) %>% 
  summarize(total_count = sum(Count)) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = Structural_Stage, y = total_count, colour = Stand_Composition)) +
  labs(subtitle = "Total Number of Decaying Trees by Structural Stage and Stand Composition",
       y = "Total number of wildlife trees per plot")
```

```{r message=FALSE}
tree_dat %>% 
  filter(Structural_Stage != "Herb") %>% 
  group_by(HabDat_ID, Structural_Stage, SMR) %>% 
  summarize(total_count = sum(Count)) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = Structural_Stage, y = total_count, colour = SMR)) +
  labs(subtitle = "Total Number of Decaying Trees by Structural Stage and SMR",
       y = "Total number of wildlife trees per plot")
```

## Model

Two models: one for total number of decaying trees (both conifers and deciduous) and a second just for deciduous decaying trees.

### Total Number of Decaying Trees

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE}
# Sum trees of all decay classes for each station.
tree_total <- tree_dat %>% 
  filter(Structural_Stage != "Herb") %>% 
  droplevels() %>% 
  group_by(HabDat_ID, SMR, Stand_Composition, Structural_Stage) %>% 
  summarize(count_total = sum(Count))
```

Below is (1) a frequency histogram of all data and (2) a goodness of fit test for a negative binomial distribution. The data fits negative binomial distribution.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
hist(tree_total$count_total)  

fit_nbinom <- goodfit(tree_total$count_total, type = "nbinomial")
rootogram(fit_nbinom)
```

GLM with negative binomial distribution was used. Model equations with all possible variations of the three explanatory variables were fit. Table below shows ranking of each model by AICc.

```{r}
model_nb_full <- glm.nb(count_total ~ Structural_Stage + SMR + Stand_Composition, 
                        data = tree_total,
                        na.action = "na.fail")
dredge(model_nb_full)
```

Best model has SMR and structural stage. Though not very different from model with all three variables. It appears that stand composition has little influence on total number of decaying trees.

Models with interactions were attempted but could not be fit. There are not enough samples in the various combinations of variables to model interactions.

**Best Model: Structural Stage and SMR**\
The outputs below provide a summary of the best model, analysis of residuals and quick look at effects.

```{r paged.print=TRUE}
model_nb <- glm.nb(count_total ~ Structural_Stage + SMR, 
                        data = tree_total)
summary(model_nb)

# Simulate residuals to check model fit. 
simulationOutput <- simulateResiduals(fittedModel = model_nb, plot = T)

# Quick check
ae <- allEffects(model_nb)
plot(ae)
```

**Estimation of Decaying Tree Density**

Estimation of decaying tree density by each combination of structural stage and SMR.

Some of the combinations of SMR and Structural Stage do not exist, either in the wildlife tree data or as mapped ecosystems in the footprint (n = 3). So that we don't waste time on trying to interpret patterns for these cases that have not been measured AND are not in the footprint, they have been removed and do not show up in the plots.

```{r}
means_total_trees <- emmeans(model_nb, specs = c( "SMR", "Structural_Stage"), type = "response")
means_total_trees <- tidy(summary(means_total_trees)) %>%  
  arrange(SMR) %>% 
  mutate(SMR = factor(SMR, levels = c("dry", "mesic", "moist", "wet")),
         Structural_Stage = factor(Structural_Stage, levels = c("Shrub", "P-S", "Young", "Mature", "Old"))
         ) %>% 
  rename(total_trees = response) %>% 
  mutate(removal_flag = case_when(
    SMR == "wet" & Structural_Stage %in% c("Mature", "Old") ~ "not mapped in footprint",
    SMR == "dry" & Structural_Stage == "Old" ~ "not mapped in footprint",
    TRUE ~ "keep")
    ) %>% 
  filter(removal_flag == "keep")
write_csv(means_total_trees, here("cavity_trees", "out", "total_trees_estimates.csv"))
means_total_trees
```

```{r}
total_trees_plot <- means_total_trees %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Structural_Stage, y = total_trees, fill = SMR))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.5, position = position_dodge())+
  labs(subtitle = "Estimated Number of Decaying Trees")+
  xlab(label = "Structural Stage") +
  ylab(label = "Decaying Tree Density (# / 400m2) with 95% CI")+
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = asymp.LCL, ymax = asymp.UCL), 
                width = 0.05,
                position = position_dodge(.5)
                ) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.title=element_text(size=10))
total_trees_plot
```

Highest densities are in mesic sites and in young forest. Interesting that the highest density is in young forest. Might logically think that older stands would have more dying trees. However this pattern could be explained by overall tree density: younger stands tend to have more stems than older stands. If we were estimating proportion of wildlife trees of all tree stems (living and dead), the pattern might be different.

### Number of Decaying Deciduous Trees

The above analysis all over again. Will not show some of the detail.

```{r}
# Using the summary data instead on this round.
tree_dat_sum <- 
  read_xlsx(here("cavity_trees", "dat", "wildlife_tree_data.xlsx"), 
                      sheet = "WT11_summary") %>% 
  mutate(Structural_Stage = case_when(
    Structural_Stage == "2" ~ "Herb",
    Structural_Stage == "3" ~ "Shrub",
    Structural_Stage == "4" ~ "P-S",
    Structural_Stage == "5" ~ "Young",
    Structural_Stage == "6" ~ "Mature",
    Structural_Stage == "7" ~ "Old")
    ) %>% 
  mutate(Structural_Stage = factor(Structural_Stage, 
                                   levels = c("Herb", "Shrub", "P-S", "Young", "Mature", "Old")),
         Stand_Composition = factor(Stand_Composition),
         SMR = factor(SMR, levels = c("dry", "mesic", "moist", "wet"))
         )
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE}
tree_decid <- tree_dat_sum %>% 
  dplyr::select(HabDat_ID:BHC, Conif_Tot:Trees_Total) %>% 
  filter(Structural_Stage != "Herb") %>% 
  droplevels() %>% 
  group_by(HabDat_ID, SMR, Stand_Composition, Structural_Stage) %>% 
  summarize(count_total = sum(Decid_Tot))

hist(tree_decid$count_total)
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
model_nb_full <- glm.nb(count_total ~ Structural_Stage + SMR + Stand_Composition, 
                        data = tree_decid,
                        na.action = "na.fail")
dredge(model_nb_full)
```

Best model is the full model with SMR, stand composition and structural stage.

Models with interactions were attempted but could not be fit. There are not enough samples in the various combinations of variables to model interactions.

Model summary, analysis of residuals and quick look at effects.

```{r paged.print=TRUE}
model_nb <- glm.nb(count_total ~ Structural_Stage + Stand_Composition + SMR, 
                        data = tree_decid)
summary(model_nb)

# Simulate residuals to check model fit. 
simulationOutput <- simulateResiduals(fittedModel = model_nb, plot = T)

# Quick check
ae <- allEffects(model_nb)
plot(ae)
```

**Estimation of Decaying Deciduous Tree Density**

Estimation of deciduous decaying tree density by each combination of structural stage, SMR and Stand Composition.

As before, combinations that have not been measured AND are not in the footprint (n=6) have been removed and do not show up in the plots.

```{r}
means_total_decid <- emmeans(model_nb, specs = c( "SMR", "Structural_Stage", "Stand_Composition"), type = "response")
means_total_decid <- tidy(summary(means_total_decid)) %>%  
  arrange(SMR) %>% 
  mutate(SMR = factor(SMR, levels = c("dry", "mesic", "moist", "wet")),
         Structural_Stage = factor(Structural_Stage, levels = c("Shrub", "P-S", "Young", "Mature", "Old"))
         ) %>% 
  rename(total_trees = response) %>% 
  mutate(removal_flag = case_when(
    SMR == "wet" & Structural_Stage %in% c("Mature", "Old") ~ "not mapped in footprint",
    SMR == "dry" & Structural_Stage == "Old" ~ "not mapped in footprint",
    TRUE ~ "keep")
    ) %>% 
  filter(removal_flag == "keep")

# Table not displayed. Uncomment below to 
# means_total_decid
```

Hard to visualize effect of three variables in two-dimensional plot. The plot is shown twice, once for deciduous stands and the second for coniferous stands.

```{r}
decid_snags_plot1 <- means_total_decid %>%
  filter(Stand_Composition == "decid") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Structural_Stage, y = total_trees, fill = SMR))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.5, position = position_dodge())+
  labs(subtitle = "Deciduous Decaying Trees in\n Deciduous Stands")+
  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,5)) +
  xlab(label = "Structural Stage") +
  ylab(label = "Density (# / 400m2) with 95% CI")+
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = asymp.LCL, ymax = asymp.UCL), 
                width = 0.05,
                position = position_dodge(.5)
                ) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.title=element_text(size=10))

decid_snags_plot2 <- means_total_decid %>%
  filter(Stand_Composition == "conif") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Structural_Stage, y = total_trees, fill = SMR))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.5, position = position_dodge())+
  labs(subtitle = "Deciduous Decaying Trees in\n Coniferous Stands")+
  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,5)) +
  xlab(label = "Structural Stage") +
  ylab(label = "Density (# / 400m2) with 95% CI")+
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = asymp.LCL, ymax = asymp.UCL), 
                width = 0.05,
                position = position_dodge(.5)
                ) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.title=element_text(size=10))

# Make 1 plot of both
pdf(NULL)
decid_snags_plot_both <- 
  ggarrange(decid_snags_plot1, decid_snags_plot2,
            legend = "bottom",
            common.legend = TRUE)
x = dev.off()
decid_snags_plot_both
```

## Extrapolation to Entire Footprint

The total number of decaying trees in the footprint can be estimated by multiplying the density estimates by the area mapped in the footprint and summing across all categories.

First bring in the footprint ecosystem summary calculations and summarize by SMR, Stand Composition and Structural Stage.

```{r message=FALSE}
footprint_eco <- 
  read_xlsx(here("cavity_trees", "dat", "wildlife_tree_data.xlsx"), 
                      sheet = "Footprint_CEM_EU") %>% 
  rename(Structural_Stage = `Structural Stage`)

footprint_eco_sum <- footprint_eco %>% 
  filter(Structural_Stage > 2 & `BEC Variant` == "BWBSmw1") %>% 
  filter(SMR != "NA") %>% 
  mutate(Structural_Stage = case_when(
    Structural_Stage == "3" ~ "Shrub",
    Structural_Stage == "4" ~ "P-S",
    Structural_Stage == "5" ~ "Young",
    Structural_Stage == "6" ~ "Mature",
    Structural_Stage == "7" ~ "Old")
    ) %>% 
  group_by(SMR, Structural_Stage, Stand_Composition) %>% 
  summarize(Area_Total = sum(`Total (ha)`))
```

Total area (hectares) of potential cavity nest habitat (shrub and forest) is: `r format(sum(footprint_eco_sum$Area_Total), 0)`

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
tree_total_detail <- footprint_eco_sum %>% 
  group_by(SMR, Structural_Stage) %>% 
  summarize(Area_Total = sum(Area_Total)) %>% 
  left_join(means_total_trees, by = c("SMR", "Structural_Stage")) %>% 
  mutate(trees_per_ha = total_trees / 400 * 10000,
         footprint_trees = Area_Total * trees_per_ha,
         LCL = asymp.LCL / 400 * 10000 * Area_Total,
         UCL = asymp.UCL / 400 * 10000 * Area_Total) %>% 
  dplyr::select(SMR, Structural_Stage, trees_per_ha, Area_Total, footprint_trees, LCL, UCL)
tree_total_detail %>% 
  kable(caption = "<strong>Table 3. Estimated number of decaying trees in footprint</strong>", digits = 1) %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE,
                position = "left")
```

**Total estimated number of decaying trees lost to footprint:** `r format(sum(tree_total_detail$footprint_trees, na.rm = TRUE), digits = 0)`

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
snag_total_detail <- footprint_eco_sum %>% 
  group_by(SMR, Stand_Composition, Structural_Stage) %>% 
  summarize(Area_Total = sum(Area_Total)) %>% 
  left_join(means_total_decid) %>% 
  mutate(snags_per_ha = total_snags / 400 * 10000,
         footprint_snags = Area_Total * snags_per_ha) %>% 
  dplyr::select(SMR, Structural_Stage, snags_per_ha, Area_Total, footprint_snags)
snag_total_detail
```

**Estimated total number of deciduous snags in the footprint:**

```{r}
sum(snag_total_detail$footprint_snags, na.rm = TRUE)
```
