Exploration of bird community metrics using Site C bird point count survey data.

What do I want to do?  
1. Some basic data summaries  
2. Species richness and diversity  
3. Expected diversity using rarefaction  
4. Community structure exploration using ordination and cluster analysis  
5. Indicator species analysis  

# Import Data
Import the tidied raw songbird station and observation data.

```{r Import}
# Run the script that imports raw stations, surveys and observation data from Excel and does quick check. The QA results are not shown in this notebook. 

# This is not working
source("point_counts/import_and_prep/point_count_data_import.R")
```
